My dog got out and I had to chase them down the block.
I needed to take a restroom break.
There was a power surge and my internet cut out.
I had food in the oven I needed to get out.
A door to door sales man was trying to sell me extermination services.
My fire alarm was going off.
I was on another call.
I had a family emergency.
I didnt see the notification. The software must have glitched.
I spilled my coffee and needed to clean it up.
